DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 US blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Diamonds Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full
replication approach. With this strategy, all 30 securities of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are owned by the Trust. A replication management approach
results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, the Diamonds Trust (the "Trust")
advanced 4.27% versus the Dow Jones Industrials Index (the "Index", the "Dow")
gain of 4.45%. The Trust benefited from a strong December 2003 as it gained
7.00% for the month. With continued signs of a rebounding economy and the fed
funds target being maintained at one percent during that month's Federal Reserve
meeting, all indications pointed to strong earnings growth opportunities ahead.
The capture of Sadaam Hussein in December 2003 also served as a beacon of hope
amid the Middle East turmoil that helped to dampen concerns overhanging the
markets, for the time being, about some of the geopolitical risk. However, the
equity market proceeded to trade range-bound for the remainder of the fiscal
year, as improving conditions in the labor markets early on seemed to taper off
and disappoint. Surging oil prices, rising interest rates amid inflation fears,
and uncertainty surrounding the upcoming presidential election helped serve to
keep equities from moving with any conviction in either direction.

For the second consecutive fiscal year, the Dow Industrials lagged other major
U.S. benchmarks (S&P 500: 9.43%; S&P Midcap: 11.03%; and Russell 2000: 11.73%).
The biggest contributors to the Trust's performance included Exxon Mobil Corp.,
Boeing Co., and United Technologies. The biggest detractors to performance were
Intel Corp., Merck & Co., and Pfizer, Inc.

The performance information presented does not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a shareholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares. Performance data quoted represents past performance and past performance
does not guarantee future results. An investment return and principal value of
an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be
worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or
higher than performance data quoted.

The S&P 500 Index is the Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks, a
widely recognized, unmanaged index of common stock prices.

The S&P MidCap 400 Index is an unmanaged group of 400 domestic stocks chosen for
their market size, liquidity and industry group representation.

The Russell 2000 Index is an index that measures the performance of the 2,000
smallest companies in the Russell 3000 Index.

You can not invest directly in an index.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2004

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on January 14, 1998
upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If no closing sale price or official closing price is available, then the
security is valued at the previous closing sale price on the exchange which is
deemed to be the principal market for the security, or at the previous official
closing price if the security is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing
sale price or official closing price available, valuation will be determined by
the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally

accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to differing
treatments for income equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due
to wash sales. Net investment income per share calculations in the financial
highlights for all years presented exclude these differences.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2004, the Trust reclassified
$434,348,797 of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of
Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of
Assets and Liabilities.

At October 31, 2004, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio

                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the year ended October 31, 2004, the Adjustment Amount decreased
the Trust's expenses by $208,288.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2002, October 31, 2003 and
October 31, 2004 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the

pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2004, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trustee; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

OTHER INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
On November 8, 2004, State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Trustee of the
Trust, declared a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") to be distributed to
Beneficial Owners of record as of November 17, 2004. The Special Dividend is
being declared in light of the special dividend paid by Microsoft Corporation,
the common shares of which are held by the Trust. The ex-date for the Special
Dividend is November 15, 2004, and the payment date is December 2, 2004.

The Special Dividend was declared by the Trustee pursuant to authority granted
it by an amendment, dated November 8, 2004 (the "Amendment"), to the Standard
Terms and Conditions of the Trust dated as of January 1, 2004. The Amendment
expands the circumstances under which the Trustee may declare a special dividend
to include circumstances where, in the Trustee's discretion, doing so would be
advantageous to the Beneficial Owners of Trust units.
