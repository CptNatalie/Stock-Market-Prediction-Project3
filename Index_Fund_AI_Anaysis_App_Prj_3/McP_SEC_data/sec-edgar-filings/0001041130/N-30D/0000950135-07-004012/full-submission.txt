DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2007 (UNAUDITED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on January 14, 1998
upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If there is no closing sale price available or official closing price,
valuation will be determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available
information.

In September, 2006, Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such market
risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is at
least reasonably possibly that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per unit calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During the six months ended April 30, 2007, the Trust reclassified $395,898,931
of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation
Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of Assets and
Liabilities.

At October 31, 2006, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

In December 2006, the SEC issued staff guidance ("SEC Letter") that delayed the
implementation of the Financial Accounting Standards Board's ("FASB")
Interpretation No. 48, "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN 48")
and clarified its application. FIN 48 was originally released by the FASB in
July 2006. FIN 48 mandates a two-part test for recognition of a tax benefit in
the financial statement of any company (including an investment company) that
follows generally accepted accounting principles. First, the company must
determine that it has a greater than 50% likelihood of sustaining its position
based on the "technical merits" of the position. Second, the company must
determine the amount of benefit that may be recognized by considering all of the
potential outcomes and measuring the probability that each will occur. The SEC
Letter clarifies the types of guidance upon which investment companies can rely
in determining the technical merits of a tax position. In addition, the SEC
Letter permits investment companies to delay the

implementation of FIN 48 until the last NAV calculation in the first required
financial reporting period for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006.
At this time, management is evaluating the implications of FIN 48.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee
at the following annual rates for the six months ended April 30, 2007:

$0 - $499,999,999                          10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999              8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                 6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the excess amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the six months ended April 30, 2007, the Adjustment Amount
decreased the Trustee's fee by $558,686. The Adjustment Amount included an
excess of net transaction fees from processing orders of $262,170 and a Trustee
earning credit of $296,516.

Effective November 22, 2006, the Trustee changed the method for computing the
Adjustment Amount to the Trustee Fee such that all income earned with respect to
cash held for the benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee's Fee.
During the period from December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, the Trustee
applied incremental cash balance credits of $374,030 against its base fee. Such
incremental credit were calculated and applied on a daily basis for such period.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004, October 31, 2005, October
31, 2006 and the six-month period ended April 30, 2007 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), PDR Services (the "Sponsor") and State Street Global Markets LLC
("SSGM") have entered into a License Agreement pursuant to which certain Dow
Jones marks may be used in connection with the Trust subject to the payment of
license fees. SSGM is a subsidiary of the Trustee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising of the performance of their duties
to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters
into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification
clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have
not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of
loss to be remote.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.
