DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate, before expenses, the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial
Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 US blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Diamonds Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full
replication approach. With this strategy, all 30 securities of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are owned by the Trust. A replication management approach
results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

For the year ended October 31, 2005, the Diamonds Trust (the "Trust") rose 6.23%
versus the Dow Jones Industrials Index (the "Index", the "Dow") gain of 6.45%.
The Trust realized much of the year's return from a strong November and December
2004 as it gained close to 8.00% over that two month period. The catalysts for
this initial surge included several solid corporate earnings reports, an end to
the uncertainty surrounding the presidential election, and a decline in energy
prices which sparked a rebound in consumer confidence. For the remainder of the
twelve-month period, the market remained range-bound, by and large, as oil
prices resumed their steep ascent, rising first through the $60 per barrel level
and then quickly approaching the $70 per barrel level after Hurricane Katrina
made landfall in the Gulf area on August 29, 2005. This sparked increasing
inflation concerns and fears of a slowdown in global growth. As a result of
these inflationary fears, the Federal Reserve continued its steady rate-hiking
campaign, as it raised the federal funds rate in eight 25 basis point increments
during the twelve months ended October, bringing the fed funds rate level to
3.75%.

The biggest contributors to the Trust's performance included Altria Group, Inc.,
Caterpillar, Inc., and Boeing Co. On the downside, the biggest detractors to
performance were General Motors Corp., Alcoa, Inc., and Pfizer, Inc.

The performance information presented does not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a unitholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
units. Performance data quoted represents past performance and past performance
does not guarantee future results. An investment return and principal value of
an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be
worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or
higher than performance data quoted.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2005

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing
proportionate undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of
substantially all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in
the Trust is referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on
January 14, 1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to
ten "Creation Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities
assembled to reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If no closing sale price or official closing price is available, then the
security is valued at the previous closing sale price on the exchange which is
deemed to be the principal market for the security, or at the previous official
closing price if the security is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing
sale price available or official closing price, valuation will be determined by
the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possibly that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 2005

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per share calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, the Trust reclassified
$637,203,568 of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of
Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of
Assets and Liabilities.

At October 31, 2005, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

As of October 31, 2005, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on a federal income tax basis were
undistributed ordinary income of $10,564,333 and undistributed long term capital
gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee
at the following annual rates for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005:

<Table>

$0 - $499,999,999                           10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999               8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                  6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, the Adjustment Amount
reduced the Trustee's fee by $301,365. The Adjustment Amount included an excess
of net transaction fees from processing orders of $20,973 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $280,392.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2002, October 31, 2003, October
31, 2004 and October 31, 2005 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), PDR Services (the "Sponsor") and State Street Global Markets, LLC
("SSGM") have entered into a License Agreement pursuant to which certain Dow
Jones marks may be used in connection with the Trust subject to the payment of
license fees. SSGM is a subsidiary of the Trustee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the
Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of loss to be remote.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

contributions, net in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2005, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
