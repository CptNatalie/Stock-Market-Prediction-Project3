DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To provide investment results that, before expenses, generally correspond to the
price and yield performance of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 US blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Trust ended its fiscal year on October 31, 2006 with a 12-month return of
18.23% on net asset value as compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average (the
"Dow") return of 18.47%.

For the twelve month period ended October 31, 2006, the Dow rose 18.47%,
extending the performance from the previous year. In the first half of the
period, the Dow rose 10.24% as strong corporate profits and solid economic
growth overcame rising interest rates, inflation fears, and high commodity
prices. Volatility increased during the period as investors balanced these
concerns with fears of a hard landing in the economy and concerns over new
Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke's ability to strike a balance between growth
and inflation.

At the end of June the Federal Funds rate was increased to 5.25%, and has since
paused at that level, while the Federal Reserve monitors the impact of the long,
steady increase of the overnight rate. The markets received an additional boost
in the second part of the year from falling energy prices. The Goldman Sachs
Commodity(R) Index (GSCI), with its very heavy energy weighting, fell 19.31% in
the three months ending October 31, 2006. This dramatic fall erased GSCI gains
earlier in the year, and the index ended the year down 14.32%. Lower commodity
prices helped to reduce some inflation concerns. In addition, some investors
hoped the falling energy prices would help boost consumer confidence and
spending. Consumer sentiment suffered during the year while the US housing
market moved through its first correction in some time. The Dow rebounded from a
slightly negative fiscal third quarter with a solid gain of 8.62% in the fiscal
fourth quarter, ending the twelve months up 18.47%.

Telecommunications stocks in the Dow had the highest returns during the year.
Several large mergers helped fuel gains in the sector. Energy stocks also posted
strong gains despite the fall of energy prices late in the year. High prices
during most of the year led to very strong earnings for Exxon Mobil. Healthcare
stocks also performed well. In fact, only the Consumer Staples stocks managed
less than a double digit gain, but still posted a respectable gain.

Gains were spread throughout the Dow, as twenty eight of the thirty names posted
gains for the year. Many names posted strong double digit gains. AT&T Inc ,
Merck & Co. Inc. and McDonald's Corp. were a few of the strongest contributors
during the year. AT&T benefited from mergers in the telecommunications sector,
while Merck and McDonald's benefited from improved results.

The performance information presented does not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a unitholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
units. Performance data quoted represents past performance and past performance
does not guarantee future results. An investment return and principal value of
an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's units, when redeemed, may be
worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or
higher than performance quoted.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2006

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing
proportionate undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of
substantially all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in
the Trust is referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on
January 14, 1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to
ten "Creation Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities
assembled to reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If there is no closing sale price available or official closing price,
valuation will be determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available
information.

In September, 2006, Statements of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for fiscal years
beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value, establishes a
framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Trust's financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 2006

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per DIAMOND calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the Trust reclassified
$413,859,607 of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of
Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of
Assets and Liabilities.

At October 31, 2006, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

<Table>

As of October 31, 2006, the components of distributable earnings (excluding

undistributed ordinary income of $11,417,177 and undistributed long term capital
gain of $0.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing a fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications, if any, of FIN 48 and its impact on the Trust's
financial statements has not yet been determined.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee
at the following annual rates for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006:

<Table>
<Caption>
NET ASSET VALUE OF THE TRUST                FEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSET VALUE OF THE TRUST

$0 - $499,999,999                           10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999               8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                  6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the excess amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the Adjustment Amount
decreased the Trustee's fee by $359,776. The Adjustment Amount included a
deficiency of net transaction fees from processing orders of $59,027 and a
Trustee earning credit of $418,803.

Effective November 22, 2006, the Trustee has changed the method of computing the
Adjustment Amount to the Trustee Fee such that all income earned with respect to
the cash held for the benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee's
Fee. In addition, during the period from December 1, 2006 through December 31,
2006, the Trustee will apply an incremental cash balance credits of
approximately $375,000 (or less than $0.0003 per share per day, assuming 53
million outstanding shares) against its base fee. Such incremental credit will
be calculated and applied on a daily basis for such period.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2004, October 31, 2005 and
October 31, 2006 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") and State Street Global Markets, LLC
("SSGM") have entered into a License Agreement pursuant to which certain Dow
Jones marks may be used in connection with the Trust subject to the payment of
license fees. SSGM is a subsidiary of the Trustee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the
Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of loss to be remote.

NOTE 4 -- TRUST TRANSACTIONS IN DIAMONDS

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2006, the Trust had net in-kind
contributions, net in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment
securities of $13,287,283,074, $11,504,484,973, $678,200 and $720,258,
respectively. At October 31, 2006, the cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes was $7,141,078,239 accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation was
$125,280,804, and gross unrealized depreciation was $713,251,734, resulting in
net unrealized depreciation of $587,970,930.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2006, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing
the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee,
and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2006 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
