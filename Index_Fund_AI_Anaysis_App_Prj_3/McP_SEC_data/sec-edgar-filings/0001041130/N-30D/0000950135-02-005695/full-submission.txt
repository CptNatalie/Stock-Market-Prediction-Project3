DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 US blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Diamonds Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full
replication approach. With this strategy, all 30 securities of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are owned by the Trust. A replication management approach
results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, the Diamonds Trust (the "Trust") was
down -5.71% versus the Dow Jones Industrials Index (the "Index", the "Dow")
return of -5.56%. This marks the second consecutive down year for the Index and
only the fourth year in the last twenty-four years in which the Dow has posted a
negative return. Growing unemployment, a continued lack of capital spending by
the corporate sector, and fears of further terrorist attacks would have been
enough to depress equity values on their own; throw in some large-scale cases of
corporate fraud (Enron, WorldCom, Qwest Communications, et.al.) and some of the
largest bankruptcies in U.S. corporate history (Enron, WorldCom, Global
Crossing, etc.) and there was little to entice buyers to invest in the U.S.
market. The economy did begin to look a little brighter for investors as the
year went on with a growing number of positive earnings stories, some improving
economic numbers, and the continued resilience of the consumer helping keep the
economy afloat. These factors helped lead the index to a strong finish for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, as it advanced 10.85% in October. Looking
ahead, another 50 basis point rate reduction by the Federal Reserve in November
2002, a sweep of both the House and Senate by the Republicans (who are viewed as
friends to both businesses and investors), and a stronger than expected start to
the holiday retail season should help to provide some positive impetus for the
equity markets. However, tensions in Iraq and North Korea could keep the markets
on a consistent path for the foreseeable future.

The Dow did manage to perform significantly better than most other U.S. market
measures over the fiscal period (S&P 500: -15.10%; Russell 1000: -14.60%;
Russell 2000: -11.57%; and Russell 3000: -14.35%) except for the mid-cap segment
of the market, which returned -4.79%. Similar to last year, investors moved away
from growth stocks into more cyclical, value oriented stocks. The stocks that
benefited the most from this shift included Eastman Kodak Co. (+37.66%), 3M Co.
(+23.97%), and Procter & Gamble Co. (+22.95%). Technology and Telecommunications
issues continued to bring up the rear as these sectors returned -28.13% and
- -34.11%, respectively. IBM Corp., led the downslide, falling -26.41%. Other
significant detractors to performance were SBC Communications Inc. (-29.87%) and
J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. (-37.47%). The latter was hurt by its exposure to Latin
America as well as its exposure to troubled U.S. companies such as Enron, Qwest,
and WorldCom.

The performance information presented does not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a shareholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares. Past performance does not predict future results.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2002

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMONDS Unit". The Trust commenced operations on January 14,
1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no closing sale
price is available, then the security is valued at the previous closing sale
price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the
security. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will be
determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

ORGANIZATION COSTS
The Trust incurred organization costs of $2,307,929, which have been capitalized
and are being charged to operations ratably over a period of 60 months.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 2002

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments for income equalization, in-kind
transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net investment income per
share calculations in the financial highlights for all years presented exclude
these differences. During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002, the Trust
reclassified $175,913,344 of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind
redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the
Statement of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust incurred net capital losses of
$9,197,094 for the fiscal period ended October 31, 1999, $11,386,433 for the
fiscal year ended October 31, 2000 and $2,065,467 for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2002. These losses may be utilized to offset any net realized
capital gains through October 31, 2007, October 31, 2008 and October 31, 2010,
respectively.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended October 31, 2002,
2001 and 2000 were as follows:

</Table>

As of October 31, 2002, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on a federal income tax basis were
undistributed ordinary income of $6,295,375 and undistributed long term capital
gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee
at the following annual rates for the year ended October 31, 2002:

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR (CONTINUED)
The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the year ended October 31, 2002, the Adjustment Amount decreased
the Trustee's fee by $317,064. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $255,458 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $61,606.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2000, October 31, 2001 and
October 31, 2002 were $2,597,968, $0 and $0 respectively. From the period
November 1, 1999 through February 29, 2000, State Street Bank and Trust Company
(the "Trustee") agreed to waive the Trustee's fee. The amount of such waiver by
the Trustee for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000 was $599,740.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") have entered into a License Agreement
pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2002, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2002 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
