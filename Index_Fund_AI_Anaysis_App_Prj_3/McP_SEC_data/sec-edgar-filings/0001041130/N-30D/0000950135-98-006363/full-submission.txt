DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 1998

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMONDS Unit". The Trust commenced operations on January 14,
1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" - see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
effect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual
results could differ from these estimates. The following is a summary of
significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION

Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no closing sale
price is available, then the security is valued at the closing bid price on the
exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If there
is no closing bid price available, valuation will be determined by the Trustee
in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS

The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

ORGANIZATION COSTS

The Trust incurred organization costs of $2,307,929, which have been capitalized
and are being charged to operations ratably over a period of 60 months.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 1998


FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Trust intends to qualify for and elect treatment as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. During
the fiscal period ended October 31, 1998, the Trust reclassified $27,588,053 of
non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units
(Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and
Liabilities. The Trust incurred net capital losses of $282,282 for the fiscal
period ended October 31, 1998. These losses may be utilized to offset any net
realized capital gains through October 31, 2006.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR

In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered in exchange for the issuance of Creation Units of the Trust, and for
adjusting the composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform
to changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of the DJIA. For these
services, the Trustee receives a fee at the following annual rates:

<TABLE>
<CAPTION>
Net asset value of the Trust       Fee as a percentage of net asset value of the Trust 
- ----------------------------       --------------------------------------------------- 
<S>                                <C>
$0 - $499,999,999                  15/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount 
$500,000,000 - $999,999,999        13/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
$1,000,000,000 - and above         11/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
</TABLE>

During the first two years of operation of the Trust, the Trustee's fee shall be
reduced to 12/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount for any
day on which the net asset value of the Trust is below $350,000,000. The
Adjustment Amount is the excess or deficiency of expenses incurred in processing
orders for creations and redemptions of DIAMONDS less transaction fees and
Trustee earnings credits. During the period ended October 31, 1998, the
Adjustment Amount increased the Trustee's fee by $3,832. The Adjustment Amount
included a deficiency of net transaction fees from processing orders of ($9,000)
and a Trustee earnings credit of $5,168.

For the period ended October 31, 1998, PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock Exchange LLC) and State Street
Bank and Trust Company (the "Trustee") agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or
assume, the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of
1% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust. The amount of such
reimbursement by the Sponsor and Trustee for the period ended October 31, 1998
was $4,301,113 and $231,341, respectively.

</TABLE>


Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

For the period ended October 31, 1998, the Trust had in-kind contributions,
in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of
$577,209,928, $280,275,121, $8,603,316, and $9,152,213, respectively. At October
31, 1998, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was
$362,335,234, accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation was $15,210,713 and
gross unrealized depreciation was $20,995,328, resulting in net unrealized
depreciation of $5,784,615.
