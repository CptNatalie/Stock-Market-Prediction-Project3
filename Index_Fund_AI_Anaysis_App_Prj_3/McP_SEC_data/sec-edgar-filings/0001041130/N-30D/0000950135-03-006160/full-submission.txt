DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 U.S. blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Diamonds Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full
replication approach. With this strategy, all 30 securities of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are owned by the Trust. A replication management approach
results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

The U.S. stock market experienced a rebound during the year ended October 31,
2003, regaining some of the ground lost during the bear market. Economic
stimulus, in the form of interest rate reductions and tax cuts, and improved
economic indicators helped balance the market. Three of the first four months of
the fiscal year finished in negative territory as oil prices shot up to near $40
per barrel in anticipation of the looming conflict in the Middle East.
Fortunately, the relatively quick initial phase of the war in Iraq, followed by
better than expected economic reports, fueled the performance of the Dow Jones
Industrials Index (the "Dow"), resulting in positive returns for seven of the
remaining eight months of the fiscal year. The passing of another fiscal
stimulus package, better than expected corporate earnings, stabilizing numbers
on employment, and economic growth in the third quarter also played important
roles in the market's upswing.

Most of the companies in the Dow posted positive returns for the year. There
were only six stocks in the Dow that failed to achieve positive returns for the
fiscal year. The companies which posted the largest gains during the year
included Intel Corp., Caterpillar, Inc., and JP Morgan Chase & Co. On the
downside, the largest losses were posted by AT&T Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., and
Johnson & Johnson Company.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2003

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on January 14, 1998
upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If no closing sale price or official closing price is available, then the
security is valued at the previous closing sale price on the exchange which is
deemed to be the principal market for the security, or at the previous official
closing price if the security is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing
sale price or official closing price available, valuation will be determined by
the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

ORGANIZATION COSTS
The Trust incurred organization costs of $2,307,929, which were capitalized and
amortized to operations ratably over a period of 60 months. All organization
costs have been fully amortized at October 31, 2003.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for

each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing during each calendar year
substantially all of its net investment income and capital gains, if any, the
Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax. Income and capital gain
distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments for income equalization, in-kind
transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net investment income per
share calculations in the financial highlights for all years presented exclude
these differences.

During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2003, the Trust reclassified
$344,985,341 of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of
Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of
Assets and Liabilities.

At October 31, 2003, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

As of October 31, 2003, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on a federal income tax basis were
undistributed ordinary income of $10,192,335 and undistributed long term capital
gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio

                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the year ended October 31, 2003, the Adjustment Amount decreased
the Trustee's fee by $337,065. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $275,195 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $61,870.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2001, October 31, 2002 and
October 31, 2003 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") have entered into a License Agreement
pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2003, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trustee; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by the Trustee, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at October 31, 2003 by correspondence with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
