TRUST OVERVIEW


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000, the Diamonds Trust (the "Trust")
returned a positive 3.7%. The Trust finished 1999 with a 7.2% gain for the
months of November and December. Increases in worker productivity with little
resulting signs of inflationary pressures made the outlook attractive for
investors. However, the Federal Reserve continued to raise short-term rates in
an effort to prevent the economy from overheating while attempting to
orchestrate a "soft-landing" for the economy. As a result, the ride for the
equity markets in 2000 has been anything but smooth. The Trust declined 11.8% in
the months of January and February wiping out its positive start to the fiscal
year. A rise in March of 7.8% was followed by three consecutive months of
negative returns. Technology stocks finally began to fall back to earth as
investors realized that the incredibly high valuations for some of these
companies could no longer be justified. The technology sector had a more
significant impact on the Trust's performance than in prior years due to the
additions of Microsoft and Intel to the index at the beginning of the year. With
the economy continuing to grow and unemployment hovering around 4%, fears of
inflation lingered and sustained periods of rapid earnings growth seemed to be
in jeopardy. This sparked the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates again
in May, and this time by 50 basis points. The Trust came charging back in August
with a return of 6.7%, but a slew of earnings disappointments caused a pullback
in the market in September. This was characteristic of the entire year as the
equity market could not seem to sustain any momentum as it had done so easily in
the past few years. The fiscal year saw increasing volatility and lighter than
usual volumes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had nearly 40% of it's trading
days posting returns in excess of +/- 1%, while the NASDAQ had nearly 70% of
it's trading days end with the same results.

The largest positive performers in the Dow Jones Industrial Average ("Dow")
during this twelve month period included Hewlett Packard (68.1%), Philip Morris
(53.2%), and Boeing (48.4%). The largest negative performers in the Dow over the
same period were AT&T (-48.5%), Caterpillar (-34.2%), and Eastman Kodak
(-32.4%).

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2000


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION

DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMONDS Unit". The Trust commenced operations on January 14,
1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" - see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.


NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.


SECURITY VALUATION

Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no closing sale
price is available, then the security is valued at the previous closing sale
price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the
security. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will be
determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.


INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS

Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.


DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS

The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.


ORGANIZATION COSTS

The Trust incurred organization costs of $2,307,929, which have been capitalized
and are being charged to operations ratably over a period of 60 months.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 2000


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEDERAL INCOME TAX

The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying, the Trust will not be subject to federal income taxes to the
extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net realized capital
gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing during each calendar
year substantially all of its net investment income and capital gains, if any,
the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax. Income and capital gain
distributions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may
differ from generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are
primarily due to differing treatments for income equalization, in-kind
transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. During the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2000, the Trust reclassified $201,180,978 of non-taxable security
gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an
increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The
Trust incurred net capital losses of $282,282 for the fiscal period ended
October 31, 1998, $17,127,379 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1999, and
$11,386,434 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000. These losses may be
utilized to offset any net realized capital gains through October 31, 2006,
October 31, 2007, and October 31, 2008, respectively.


NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR

In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered in exchange for the issuance of Creation Units of the Trust, and for
adjusting the composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform
to changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of the DJIA. For these
services, the Trustee received a fee at the following annual rates for the
period November 1, 1999 through February 29, 2000:

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR (CONTINUED)

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended October 31, 2000, the Adjustment Amount decreased the
Trustee's fee by $197,821. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $64,315 and a Trustee earnings credit
of $133,506.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000, PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a
wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse
the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary operating expenses of the Trust which
exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the daily net asset value of the Trust.
The amount of such reimbursement by the Sponsor for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 2000 was $2,597,968. From the period November 1, 1999 through
February 29, 2000, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the "Trustee") agreed to
waive the Trustee's fee. The amount of such waiver by the Trustee for the period
was $599,740.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") have entered into a License Agreement
pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS


- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2000, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2000 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
