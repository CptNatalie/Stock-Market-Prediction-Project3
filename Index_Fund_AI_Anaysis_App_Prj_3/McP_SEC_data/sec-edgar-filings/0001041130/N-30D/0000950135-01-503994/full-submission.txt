DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, which is designed to capture the price performance of 30 US blue-chip
stocks that are generally considered leaders within their respective industries.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The DIAMONDS Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of
the Dow Jones Industrial Average. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full
replication approach. With this strategy, all 30 securities of the Dow Jones
Industrial Average are owned by the Trust. A replication management approach
results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2001, the Diamonds Trust was down -15.91%
as compared to the Dow Jones Industrial Average return of -15.55%. Repeated
earnings warnings, sizeable layoffs, a buildup in inventories, and a subsequent
lack of capital spending caused recessionary fears to proliferate. The Trust
experienced significant volatility in its monthly returns during the fiscal
year. However, all of this seemed to be temporarily offset, by the Federal
Reserve's third 50 basis point interest rate cut of the year on March 20, 2001.
As a result, the Trust gained 8.76% during the month of April, recouping all of
the losses from the previous quarter. By the end of August, the Federal Reserve
had cut interest rates seven times to the tune of 300 basis points while the
federal government had issued tax rebate checks and unveiled a substantial tax
cut to help spark the economy. Nevertheless, layoffs increased, corporate
earnings continued to suffer, and the economy continued to stagger. Investors
grew discouraged about the prospects of a turnaround and a global recession
seemed inevitable. In September, the world was shocked by the events of
September 11th which sent the equity markets reeling. The Trust lost -5.20% in
August and -10.98% in September. The good news going forward is that there is
significant economic stimulus in place (10 interest rate cuts now totaling 4.5%)
and consumer spending, despite the current environment and the significant jump
in unemployment numbers, continues to show surprising resiliency. The Trust
gained 2.67% in October.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average did outperform all other large capitalization
US market measures as investors moved away from technology and other growth
stocks into more defensive, value oriented stocks. The stocks that benefited the
most from this shift included defensive issues such as Philip Morris (+33.71%),
Caterpillar (+31.48%), Johnson & Johnson (+27.20%), and Alcoa (+15.01%). The Dow
components that suffered during the period were, not surprisingly, technology
issues and, mainly as a result of the events of September 11th, securities in
the travel and tourism industry. These issues included Hewlett Packard
(-63.12%), Boeing Co. (-50.97%), American Express (-50.42%), and Walt Disney
(-47.50%).

The performance information presented does not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a shareholder would pay on Trust distributions or the redemption of Trust
shares. Past performance does not predict future results.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
OCTOBER 31, 2001

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMONDS Unit". The Trust commenced operations on January 14,
1998 upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no closing sale
price is available, then the security is valued at the previous closing sale
price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the
security. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will be
determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

ORGANIZATION COSTS
The Trust incurred organization costs of $2,307,929, which have been capitalized
and are being charged to operations ratably over a period of 60 months.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per share calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences. During the fiscal year ended October
31, 2001, the Trust reclassified $210,774,140 of non-taxable security gains
realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statements of Assets and Liabilities. The Trust incurred
net capital losses of $9,197,094 for the fiscal period ended October 31, 1999
and

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
OCTOBER 31, 2001

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

$11,386,433 for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2000. These losses may be
utilized to offset any net realized capital gains through October 31, 2007 and
October 31, 2008, respectively.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee
at the following annual rates for the year ended October 31, 2001:

$0 - $499,999,999                           10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999               8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                  6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended October 31, 2001, the Adjustment Amount decreased the
Trustee's fee by $398,026. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $237,193 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $160,833.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 1999, October 31, 2000, and
October 31, 2001 were $1,418,867, $2,597,968, and $0 respectively. From the
period November 1, 1998 through February 29, 2000, State Street Bank and Trust
Company (the "Trustee") agreed to waive the Trustee's fee. The amounts of such
waivers by the Trustee for the fiscal years ended October 31, 1999, and October
31, 2000 were $912,453 and $599,740 respectively.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") have entered into a License Agreement
pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To the Trustee and Unitholders of
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the
"Trust") at October 31, 2001, and the results of its operations, the changes in
its net assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred
to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management;
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in
accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of
America, which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at October 31, 2001 by
correspondence with the custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
