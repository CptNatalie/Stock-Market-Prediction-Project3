DIAMONDS TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2005 (UNAUDITED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMONDS". The Trust commenced operations on January 14, 1998
upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If no closing sale price or official closing price is available, then the
security is valued at the previous closing sale price on the exchange which is
deemed to be the principal market for the security, or at the previous official
closing price if the security is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing
sale price available or official closing price available, valuation will be
determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)
accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to differing
treatments for income equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due
to wash sales. Net investment income per share calculations in the financial
highlights for all years presented exclude these differences.

During the six months ended April 30, 2005, the Trust reclassified $432,146,952
of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation
Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of Assets and
Liabilities.

At October 31, 2004, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

2007....................................  $  9,197,094
2008....................................    11,386,433

2011....................................    68,716,435
2012....................................   221,260,584
</Table>

EQUALIZATION
The Funds follow the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring capital shares,
equivalent on a per share basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per
share is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of capital shares.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR (CONTINUED)

structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee at the
following annual rates for the six months ended April 30, 2005:

                                            Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999               8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                  6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                            Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the six months ended April 30, 2005, the Adjustment Amount
decreased the Trustee's fee by $44,507.

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2002, October 31, 2003, October
31, 2004 and the six-month period ended April 30, 2005 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), and PDR Services (the "Sponsor") have entered into a License Agreement
pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used in connection with the
Trust subject to the payment of license fees.

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.
