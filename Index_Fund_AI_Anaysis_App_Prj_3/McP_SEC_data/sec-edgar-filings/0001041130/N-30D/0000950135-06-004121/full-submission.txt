DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
DIAMONDS Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under
the laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase units of beneficial interest in the Trust representing proportionate
undivided interests in the portfolio of securities consisting of substantially
all of the component common stocks, which comprise the Dow Jones Industrial
Average (the "DJIA"). Each unit of fractional undivided interest in the Trust is
referred to as a "DIAMOND". The Trust commenced operations on January 14, 1998
upon the initial issuance of 500,000 DIAMONDS (equivalent to ten "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official closing
price. If no closing sale price or official closing price is available, then the
security is valued at the last sale price on the exchange which is deemed to be
the principal market for the security. If there is no closing sale price
available or official closing price, and if the Trustee deems the last sale
price an inappropriate basis for evaluation, valuation will be determined by the
Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such market
risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is at
least reasonably possibly that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders monthly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per share calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Trust reclassified $230,172,710
of non-taxable security gains realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation
Units (Note 4) as an increase to paid in surplus in the Statements of Assets and
Liabilities.

At October 31, 2005, the Trust had the following capital loss carryforwards
which may be used to offset any net realized gains, expiring October 31:

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio

from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or weighting
structure of the DJIA. For these services, the Trustee received a fee at the
following annual rates for the six months ended April 30, 2006:

$0 - $499,999,999                          10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999              8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above                 6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
                                           Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of DIAMONDS and (b) the amounts earned by the
Trustee with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the
Trust. During the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Adjustment Amount
decreased the Trustee's fee by $34,908. The Adjustment Amount included a
deficiency of net transaction fees from processing orders of (-$69,600) and a
Trustee earnings credit of (+$104,508).

PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor", a wholly-owned subsidiary of the American Stock
Exchange LLC) agreed to reimburse the Trust for, or assume, the ordinary
operating expenses of the Trust which exceeded 18.00/100 of 1% per annum of the
daily net asset value of the Trust. The amounts of such reimbursements by the
Sponsor for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2003, October 31, 2004, October
31, 2005 and the six-month period ended April 30, 2006 were $0.

Dow Jones & Company, Inc. ("Dow Jones"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the
"AMEX"), the Sponsor, and State Street Global Markets, LLC ("SSGM") have entered
into a License Agreement pursuant to which certain Dow Jones marks may be used
in connection with the Trust subject to the payment of license fees. SSGM is a
subsidiary of the Trustee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising of the performance of their duties
to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust enters
into contracts with service providers that contain general indemnification
clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Trust that have
not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects the risk of
loss to be remote.

DIAMONDS TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS -- (CONTINUED)
APRIL 30, 2006 (UNAUDITED)

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, DIAMONDS are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
DIAMONDS. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a
separate cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment
income per DIAMOND (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to
equate the transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the
transaction date. A transaction fee of $1,000 is charged in connection with each
creation or redemption of Creation Units through the DIAMONDS Clearing Process
per Participating party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units
created or redeemed. Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to
offset the expense of processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the six months ended April 30, 2006, the Trust had net in-kind
contributions, net in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment
securities of $4,823,459,157, $6,745,176,364, $0 and $0, respectively. At April
30, 2006, the cost of investments for federal income tax purposes was
$6,818,292,722 accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation was $162,771,285, and
gross unrealized depreciation was $917,236,910, resulting in net unrealized
depreciation of $754,465,625.

NOTE 6 -- TAX INFORMATION
For Federal income tax purposes, the percentage of Trust ordinary distributions
which qualify for the corporate dividends received deduction for the fiscal year

For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2005, certain dividends paid by the Trust
may be designated as qualified dividend income and subject to a maximum tax rate
