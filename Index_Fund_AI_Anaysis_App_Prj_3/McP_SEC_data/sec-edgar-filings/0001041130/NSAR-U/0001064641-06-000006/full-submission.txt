Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Trustee and Unitholders
Of DIAMONDS Trust, Series I

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of
DIAMONDS Trust, Series I (the Trust) as of and for the year ended
October 31, 2005, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered
the Trusts internal control over financial reporting, including
control activities for safeguarding securities, as a basis for
designing our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our
 opinion on the financial statements and to comply with the requirements
 of Form N-SAR, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion
on the effectiveness of the Trusts internal control over financial
 reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.

The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and
 maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting.
  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by
 management are required to assess the expected benefits and related
 costs of controls.  A companys internal control over financial
 reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
 regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
 of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with
 generally accepted accounting principles.  Such internal control
 over financial reporting includes policies and procedures that
 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection
 of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of a companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
 reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections
 of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
 the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
 procedures may deteriorate.

A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control
 does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
 their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely
 basis. A significant deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination
 of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the companys ability
to initiate, authorize, record, process or report external financial data
reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles such
 that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of the
companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than
inconsequential will not be prevented or detected.  A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of
 the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected.

Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting
was for the limited purpose described in the first paragraph and would not
necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over financial
reporting that might be significant deficiencies or material weaknesses under
 standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  However, we noted no deficiencies in the Trusts internal
 control over financial reporting and its operation, including controls for
 safeguarding securities, that we consider to be material weaknesses as
defined above as of October 31, 2005.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of management
and the Trustee of DIAMONDS Trust, Series I and the Securities and Exchange
Commission and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other
than these specified parties.
