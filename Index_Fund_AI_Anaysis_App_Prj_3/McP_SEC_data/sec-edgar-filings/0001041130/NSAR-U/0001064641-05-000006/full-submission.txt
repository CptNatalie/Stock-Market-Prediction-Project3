Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Trustee and Unitholders
of Diamonds Trust, Series I

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements
of Diamonds Trust, Series I (the Trust) for the year ended
October 31, 2004, we considered its internal control, including
control activities for safeguarding securities, in order to determine
our auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on
the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form
N-SAR, not to provide assurance on internal control.

The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal control.  In fulfilling this responsibility,
estimates and judgments by management are required to assess the
expected benefits and related costs of controls.  Generally, controls
that are relevant to an audit pertain to the entitys objective of
preparing financial statements for external purposes that are fairly
presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.
Those controls include the safeguarding of assets against unauthorized
acquisition, use or disposition.

Because of inherent limitations in internal control, errors or fraud
may occur and not be detected.  Also, projection of any evaluation of
internal control to future periods is subject to the risk that controls
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the
effectiveness of their design and operation may deteriorate.

Our consideration of internal control would not necessarily disclose all
matters in internal control that might be material weaknesses under
standards established by the Public Trust Accounting Oversight Board
(United States). A material weakness, for purposes of this report, is a
condition in which the design or operation of one or more of the internal
control components does not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that
misstatements caused by error or fraud in amounts that would be material
in relation to the financial statements being audited may occur and not be
detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of
performing their assigned functions. However, we noted no matters
involving internal control and its operation, including controls for
safeguarding securities that we consider to be material weaknesses as
defined above as of October 31, 2004.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the
Trustee and its management and the Securities and Exchange Commission
and is not intended to be and should not be used by anyone other than
these specified parties.
