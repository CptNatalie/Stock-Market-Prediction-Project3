Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm

To the Trustee and Unitholders
of SPDR Trust, Series I

In planning and performing our audit of the financial statements of
SPDR Trust, Series I (the Trust) as of and for the year ended
September 30, 2005, in accordance with the standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), we considered
the Trusts internal control over financial reporting, including
controls for safeguarding securities, in order to determine our
auditing procedures for the purpose of expressing our opinion on
the financial statements and to comply with the requirements of Form
N-SAR, not to provide assurance on the Trusts internal control over
 financial reporting as of September 30, 2005.

The management of the Trust is responsible for establishing and
maintaining internal control over financial reporting.  In fulfilling
 this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are required
 to assess the expected benefits and related costs of controls.
 A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles.  Such internal control over financial reporting includes
policies and procedures that provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or
disposition of a companys assets that could have a material effect
on the financial statements.

Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial
 reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or
procedures may deteriorate.

A control deficiency exists when the design or operation of a control
does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing
their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely
basis. A significant deficiency is a control deficiency, or combination
of control deficiencies, that adversely affects the companys ability to
initiate, authorize, record, process or report external financial data
reliably in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
such that there is more than a remote likelihood that a misstatement of
 the companys annual or interim financial statements that is more than
inconsequential will not be prevented or detected. A material weakness
is a control deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, that
results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or
detected.

Our consideration of the Trusts internal control over financial reporting
would not necessarily disclose all deficiencies in internal control over
financial reporting that might be material weaknesses under standards
 established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
(United States).  However, during our audit of the financial statements
of the Trust as of and for the year ended September 30, 2005, we noted
no deficiencies in the Trusts internal control over financial reporting,
 including controls for safeguarding securities, that we consider to be
a material weakness as defined above as of September 30, 2005.

This report is intended solely for the information and use of the
 Trustee and the Securities and Exchange Commission and is not intended
to be and should not be used by anyone other than these specified parties.
