SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
The SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is an exchange traded fund designed to
generally correspond to the price yield performance of the S&P 500(R) Index.

STRATEGY:
To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full replication approach. With this
strategy, all 500 securities of the S&P 500(R) Index are owned by the Trust in
their approximate market capitalization weight. A replication management
approach should result in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to
its benchmark.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Trust ended its fiscal year on September 30, 2006 with a 12-month total
return of 10.64% on net asset value as compared to the S&P 500(R) Index return
of 10.79%.

During the year ended September 30, 2006, the S&P 500 rose 10.79%, extending the
gains from the previous year. In the early part of the year, strong corporate
profits and solid economic growth overcame rising interest rates, inflation
fears, and high commodity prices as the S&P 500 rose 6.39% during the first half
of the twelve month period ending September 30, 2006. Volatility increased
during the period as investors balanced these concerns with fears of a hard
landing in the economy and concerns over new Federal Reserve Chairman Bernanke's
ability to strike a balance between growth and inflation.

At the end of June the Federal Funds rate was increased to 5.25%, and has since
paused at that level, while the Federal Reserve monitors the impact of the long,
steady increase of the overnight rate. The markets received an additional boost
in the second part of the year from falling energy prices. The Goldman Sachs
Commodity Index, with its very heavy energy weighting, fell 15.53% in the
quarter ended September 30, 2006, and was down 21.14% for the full year. This
helped to reduce some inflation concerns. In addition, some investors hoped the
falling energy prices would help boost consumer confidence and spending.
Consumer sentiment has suffered during the year while the US housing market
moved through its first correction in some time. The S&P 500(R) rebounded from a
slightly negative third quarter with a solid gain of 5.67% in the fourth
quarter, ending the year up 10.79%.

The S&P 500 outperformed mid cap stocks by more than 4 percentage points during
the year, as the S&P MidCap 400(R) rose 6.56%. The Russell 2000(R) Index gained
9.92%. However, in the second half of the year, large caps significantly
outgained the small caps, allowing the S&P 500 to surpass the small cap index.
The S&P 500/Citigroup Value Index outgained the S&P 500/Citigroup Growth(R)
Index by more than seven percentage points, 14.61% to 7.15%. International
stocks posted excellent results as the MSCI(R) EAFE(R) Index rose 19.16%, while
the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index rose only 3.67%.

Each of the nine Select Sector Indices which combined comprise the S&P 500, rose
during the period, with the Energy Select Sector, one of the strongest
performers over the last several periods, posting the smallest gain, 1.13%. The
Financial Select Sector Index was the top performing Select Sector Index for the
year, rising 20.53%, with a large portion of that gain coming in the final
quarter when the Financial Select Sector Index rose 7.99%. The sector benefited
from the pause in interest rate hikes, and while REITs are a relatively small
portion of the index, they provided another phenomenal year, gaining 28.07% as
measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire REIT Index. The REIT market contrasted with
the malaise in the US housing market during the year.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2006
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks, in
substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Price Index (the "S&P Index"). Each unit of fractional undivided
interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipt
("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial
issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units" -- see Note 4)
in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the intended
portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official close
price. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will be determined
by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

In September, 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157"), was issued and is effective for the fiscal
years beginning after November 15, 2007. FAS 157 defines fair value, establishes
a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value
measurements. Management is currently evaluating the impact, if any, the
adoption of SFAS 157 will have on the Funds' financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)
EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per unit calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During 2006, the Trust reclassified $4,276,614,631 of non-taxable security gains
realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At September 30,
2006, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $27,700,040, $56,816,996,
$403,831,303, $472,492,447, $1,530,834,020, $445,024,832, $380,379,645, and
$1,174,140,896 which will expire on September 30, 2007, September 30, 2008,
September 30, 2009, September 30, 2010, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2012,
September 30, 2013 and September 30, 2014, respectively. The Trust incurred
losses of $1,066,922,516 during the period November 1, 2005 through September
30, 2006 that were deferred for tax purposes until fiscal 2007.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2006
was $1,059,134,562 of ordinary income. The tax character of distributions paid
during the year ended September 30, 2005 was $1,085,600,597 of ordinary income.
The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2004
was $741,887,578 of ordinary income.

As of September 30, 2006, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $42,701,199 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) released FASB
Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainly in Income Taxes" (FIN 48). FIN
48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized,
measured, presented and disclosed in the financial statements. FIN 48 requires
the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of
preparing the fund's tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are
"more-likely-than-not" of being sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax
positions not deemed to meet the more-likely-than-not threshold would be
recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is
required for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and is to be applied
to all open tax years as of the effective date. At this time, management is
evaluating the implications of FIN 48 and its impact in the financial statements
has not yet been determined.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index. For these services, the Trustee
received a fee at the following annual rates for the year ended September 30,
2006:

<Table>
<Caption>
Net asset value of the Trust      Fee as a percentage of net asset value of the Trust
- ----------------------------      ---------------------------------------------------
<S>                            <C>
$0 - $499,999,999              10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999  8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above     6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended September 30, 2006, the Adjustment Amount reduced the
Trustee's fee by $8,876,544. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $316,052 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $8,560,492.

Effective November 1, 2006, the Trustee changed the method of computing the
Adjustment Amount to the Trustee Fee such that all income earned with respect to
cash held for the benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee's Fee. In
addition, during the period from December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, the
Trustee will apply incremental cash balance credits of approximately $5.9
million (approximately $0.0005 per share per day, based upon 470 million
outstanding shares) against its base fee. Such incremental credit will be
calculated and applied on a daily basis during such period.

The Trustee voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fee, as needed, for one
year through February 1, 2007, so that the total operating expenses would not
exceed 10/100 of 1% per annum of the daily net asset value. The total amount of
such reimbursement by the Trustee for the year ended September 30, 2006 was
$11,108,781. The Trustee has not entered into an agreement with the Trust to
recapture waived fees in subsequent periods.

Standard and Poor's ("S&P") and State Street Global Markets, LLC ("SSGM") have
entered into a License Agreement. The License Agreement grants SSGM, an
affiliate of the Trustee, a license to use the S&P 500 Index as a basis for
determining the composition of the Portfolio and to use certain trade names and
trademarks of S&P in connection with the Portfolio. The Trustee on behalf of the
Trust, the American Stock Exchange LLC (the "AMEX"), and PDR Services (the
"Sponsor") have each received a sublicense from SSGM for the use of the S&P 500
Index and such trade names and trademarks in connection with their rights and
duties with respect to the Trust. The Trust pays an annual sub-license fee to
S&P equal to the greater of: (i) 0.03% of the daily average net assets of the
Trust plus a volume based fee ranging from $0.03 to $0.04 per round lot trade of
the average daily trading volume, or (ii) $125,000, the minimum annual fee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the
Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of loss to be remote.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED ISSUERS

Certain investments made by The Trust represent securities affiliated with the
Trustee. Investments in State Street Corp., the holding company of State Street
Bank and Trust Company, were made according to its representative portion of the
S&P 500 Index. The market value of these investments at September 30, 2006 is
listed in the Schedule of Investments.

</Table>

With the exception of the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, SPDRs are issued
and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
SPDRs. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate
cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per
SPDR (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the
transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction
date. A transaction fee of $3,000 is charged in connection with each creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the SPDR Clearing Process per Participating
party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed.
Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to offset the expense of
processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the year ended September 30, 2006, the Trust had in-kind contributions,
in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of
$66,547,912,601, $61,089,119,199, $2,003,252,293, and $2,544,954,612,
respectively. At September 30, 2006, the cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes was $65,117,012,818, accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation was
$1,488,481,299 and gross unrealized depreciation was $9,065,815,935, resulting
in net unrealized depreciation of $7,577,334,636.

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2006, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2006 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.
