SPDR TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the S&P 500 Index.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index, which
is designed to capture the performance of a large cross-section of the U.S.
publicly traded stock market.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of the
S&P 500 Index. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full replication
approach. With this strategy, all 500 securities of the S&P 500 Index are owned
by the Trust in their approximate market capitalization weight. A replication
management approach should result in low expected tracking error of the Trust
relative to its benchmark.

The Trust ended its fiscal year on September 30, 2004 with a 12-month total
return of 13.62% on net asset value as compared to the S&P 500 Index return of
13.87%.

Most of the gain in the S&P 500 Index was achieved in the first quarter of the
fiscal year when the Index rose 12.18%. Since then, the Index has traded in a
relatively tight range, usually within plus or minus two percentage points of
the level at the end of the 2003 calendar year.

After pricing significant expected earnings into stock prices early in the year,
the market appeared to wait and see if those earnings would materialize. Other
factors influencing the market were the presidential election, the continuing
instability in Iraq, rising short term interest rates, and increasing oil
prices. The price of a barrel of oil was just under $50 on September 30, 2004, a
70% increase from the price one year earlier. The impact of this price increase,
along with the decision of the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy by
raising short term interest rates, caused some concern over the outlook of the
U.S. economy.

Energy was the top performing sector during the last year. The Energy Select
Sector Index rose nearly 49% as the increased price of oil appeared to benefit
Energy companies. The Materials and Industrial Sectors also posted strong gains
during the year. Materials companies benefited from increased commodity prices
and Industrial companies appeared to gain on the improved economic outlook at
the start of the year. All ten sectors of the S&P 500 Index posted gains during
the year, with Information Technology posting the lowest performance.

We appreciate your support of the SPDR Trust and look forward to serving your
investment needs in the future.

SPDR TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2004
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks, in
substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Price Index (the "S&P Index"). Each unit of fractional undivided
interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipt
("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial
issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units" -- see Note 4)
in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the intended
portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official close
price. If no closing sale price is available, then the security is valued at the
previous closing sale price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal
market for the security, or at the previous official close price if the security
is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation
will be determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)
due to wash sales. Net investment income per share calculations in the financial
highlights for all years presented exclude these differences.

During 2004, the Trust reclassified $2,590,784,293 of non-taxable security gains
realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At September 30,
2004, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $33,523, $27,700,040,
$56,816,996, $403,831,303, $472,492,447, $1,530,834,020, and $445,024,832 which
will expire on September 30, 2005, September 30, 2007, September 30, 2008,
September 30, 2009, September 30, 2010, September 30, 2011, and September 30,
2012, respectively. The Trust incurred losses of $335,123,098 during the period
November 1, 2003 through September 30, 2004 that were deferred for tax purposes
until fiscal 2005.

The Tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2004
was $741,887,578 of ordinary income. The Tax character of distributions paid
during the year ended September 30, 2003 was $640,459,798 of ordinary income.

As of September 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $100,594,786 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index. For these services, the Trustee
received a fee at the following annual rates for the year ended September 30,
2004:

Except for under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, SPDRs are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 SPDRs.
Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash
payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per SPDR
(income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the transaction
to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction date. A
transaction fee of $3,000 is charged in connection with each creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the SPDR Clearing Process per Participating
party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed.
Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to offset the expense of
processing orders.

For the year ended September 30, 2004, the Trust had in-kind contributions,
in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of

SPDR TRUST SERIES 1
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2004, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trustee; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Trustee, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2004 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

OTHER INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)
On November 8, 2004, State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Trustee of the
Trust, declared a special dividend (the "Special Dividend") to be distributed to
Beneficial Owners of record as of November 17, 2004. The Special Dividend is

the Special Dividend is November 15, 2004, and the payment date is December 2,

The Special Dividend was declared by the Trustee pursuant to authority granted

expands the circumstances under which the Trustee may declare a special dividend
