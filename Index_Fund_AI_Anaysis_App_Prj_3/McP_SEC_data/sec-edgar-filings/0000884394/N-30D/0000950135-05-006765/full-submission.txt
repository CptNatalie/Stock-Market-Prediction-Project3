SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the S&P 500 Index.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index, which
is designed to capture the price performance of a large cross-section of the
U.S. publicly traded stock market.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of the
S&P 500 Index. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full replication
approach. With this strategy, all 500 securities of the S&P 500 Index are owned
by the Trust in their approximate market capitalization weight. A replication
management approach should result in low expected tracking error of the Trust
relative to its benchmark.

The Trust ended its fiscal year on September 30, 2005 with a 12-month total
return of 12.11% on net asset value as compared to the S&P 500 Index return of
12.25%.

Most of the gain in the S&P 500 was achieved in the first quarter of the fiscal
year when the Index rose 9.2%. Energy prices were a hot topic of interest during
the fiscal year. In last year's letter, we mentioned that crude oil was just
under $50 per barrel. During September 2005, oil briefly rose to over $70 per
barrel. Part of that price rise was caused by the devastating hurricanes in the
Gulf of Mexico, and the damage done to oil wells in the region. Natural gas,
gasoline, and home heating oil prices also rose significantly during the past
year. These increased energy costs have further increased inflation fears in the
United States. The Federal Reserve Bank has been steadily increasing short term
interest rates to combat inflation.

Despite the concerns, the market was strong during the year. Energy was the top
performing sector during the last year, rising 55.63%, as the increased price of
oil appeared to benefit Energy companies. Utilities also posted strong gains,
rising 38.68%. All ten economic sectors posted positive returns during the last
12 months, with Materials (+2.19%) posting the smallest gains.

Apple Computer, Inc. was one of the top performing stocks during the year,
rising 177%. The company's iPod has been a major success story in consumer
electronics. Exxon Mobil Corp. gained over 31%, contributing 95 basis points of
return to the index, the largest contribution from a single stock. As the
largest energy company in the U.S., the stock price benefited from increased
energy prices. On the flipside, Delphi Corp. and Delta Airlines both filed for
bankruptcy protection near the end of the fiscal year (Delphi Corp. was removed
from the S&P 500 Index on October 10, 2005 and Delta Airlines was removed on
August 18, 2005.)

In March 2005 and September 2005, Standard & Poor's enacted the transition of
their indices from full capitalization weights to float adjusted. In order to
provide a benchmark that better reflects the market reality of investable
shares, the capitalization of the constituents will now be modified for factors
such as cross ownership and inside ownership among others. The SPDR Trust was
rebalanced in each case to reflect these changes.

We appreciate your support of the SPDR Trust and look forward to serving your
investment needs in the future.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2005
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks, in
substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Price Index (the "S&P Index"). Each unit of fractional undivided
interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's Depositary Receipt
("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the initial
issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units" -- see Note 4)
in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the intended
portfolio composition of the Trust.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security, except for
securities listed on the NASDAQ which are valued at the NASDAQ official close
price. If no closing sale price is available, then the security is valued at the
previous closing sale price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal
market for the security, or at the previous official close price if the security
is listed on the NASDAQ. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation
will be determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust distributes net realized capital gains, if any,
at least annually.

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per unit calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During 2005, the Trust reclassified $5,827,350,104 of non-taxable security gains
realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At September 30,
2005, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $27,700,040, $56,816,996,
$403,831,303, $472,492,447, $1,530,834,020, $445,024,832, and $380,379,645 which
will expire on September 30, 2007, September 30, 2008, September 30, 2009,
September 30, 2010, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2012 and September 30,
2013, respectively. The Trust incurred losses of $1,121,370,158 during the
period October 1, 2004 through September 30, 2005 that were deferred for tax
purposes until fiscal 2006.

The Tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2005
was $1,085,600,597 of ordinary income. The Tax character of distributions paid
during the year ended September 30, 2004 was $741,887,578 of ordinary income.

As of September 30, 2005, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $92,676,213 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform

to changes in the composition and/or weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index.
For these services, the Trustee received a fee at the following annual rates for
the year ended September 30, 2005:

<Table>
<Caption>
Net asset value of the Trust      Fee as a percentage of net asset value of the Trust
- ----------------------------      ---------------------------------------------------
<S>                            <C>
$0 - $499,999,999              10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
$500,000,000 - $2,499,999,999  8/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
$2,500,000,000 - and above     6/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment Amount
</Table>

The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended September 30, 2005, the Adjustment Amount reduced the
Trustee's fee by $2,680,410. The Adjustment Amount included a deficiency of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $(50,005) and a Trustee earnings
credit of $2,730,415.

The Trustee voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fee, as needed, for one
year through February 1, 2006, so that the total operating expenses would not
exceed 10/100 of 1% per annum of the daily net asset value. The total amount of
such reimbursement by the Trustee for the year ended September 30, 2005 was
$15,133,657. The Trustee has not entered into an agreement with the Trust to
recapture waived fees in subsequent periods.

The Trust has entered into a Memorandum of Agreement with Standard and Poor's
("S&P"), the American Stock Exchange LLC (the "AMEX"), and PDR Services (the
"Sponsor") pursuant to which the Trust has obtained a sub-license to use certain
S&P marks. The Memorandum of Agreement requires the Trust to pay annually a
sub-license fee to the S&P equal to the greater of: (i) 0.03% of the Trust's
daily average net assets of the Trust plus a volume based fee ranging from $0.03
to $0.04 per round lot trade of the average daily trading volume, or (ii)
$125,000, the minimum annual fee.

INDEMNIFICATIONS
Under the Trust's organizational documents, its officers and trustees are
indemnified against certain liability arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the
Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of loss to be remote.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED ISSUERS
Certain investments made by The Trust represent securities affiliated with the
Trustee. Investments in State Street Corp., the holding company of State Street
Bank, were made according to its representative portion of the S&P 500 Index.
The market value of these investments at September 30, 2005 is listed in the
Schedule of Investments.

Except under the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, SPDRs are issued and
redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 SPDRs.
Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash
payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per SPDR
(income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the transaction
to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction date. A
transaction fee of $3,000 is charged in connection with each creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the SPDR Clearing Process per Participating
party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed.
Transaction fees are received by the Trustee and used to offset the expense of
processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the year ended September 30, 2005, the Trust had in-kind contributions,
in-kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of
$57,666,273,069, $60,825,366,614, $3,144,076,285, and $3,018,393,331,
respectively. At September 30, 2005, the cost of investments for federal income

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2005, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2005 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, provide a reasonable basis for
our opinion.

DISCLOSURE (UNAUDITED)
On November 8, 2004, the Trustee declared a special dividend ("Special
Dividend") to be distributed to Beneficial Owners of record as of November 17,
