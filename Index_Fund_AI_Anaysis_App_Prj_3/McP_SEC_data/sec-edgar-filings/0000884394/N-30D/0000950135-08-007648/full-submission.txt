SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OBJECTIVE:
The SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is an exchange traded fund designed to
generally correspond to the price yield performance of the S&P 500 Index (the
"Index").

STRATEGY:
The Trust utilizes a full replication approach. With this strategy, all 500
securities of the S&P 500 Index are owned by the Trust in their approximate
market capitalization weight. A replication management approach is expected to
result in low tracking error of the Trust relative to its benchmark.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
For the twelve months ended September 30, 2008 the Trust returned -21.84% on net
asset value and the Index returned -21.98%. Index returns do not reflect
deductions for fees and expenses associated with investing in the Fund, which
would reduce Index returns, if applied. It is not possible to invest directly in
an Index.

There were numerous headlines in the financial press over the last twelve
months. Unfortunately, many of them were not good news. We started the year in
October 2007 with news of falling housing prices, sub-prime losses, and rising
commodity prices. As we moved into 2008, a weakening dollar and rising commodity
prices spurred fears of stagflation (low or negative growth with rising prices.)
In March 2008, the major Wall Street house of Bear Stearns could no longer fund
its own business and had no choice but to sell to JP Morgan at the price of $10
per share. Skyrocketing commodity prices, falling housing prices and troubled
credit markets dominated news in late spring and early summer. As the twelve
months ended September 30, 2008, drew to a close, the markets entered a period
that has been compared to the crash of 1929. In a matter of weeks, the
traditional structure of investment banks in the United States ceased to exist.
Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch entered into a merger
with Bank of America. Soon after that, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
reorganized into bank holding companies. While these changes were occurring, the
government seized Washington Mutual, and reached a deal to sell most of its
assets to JP Morgan Chase; AIG required an $85 billion loan, and the government
unveiled plans for a $700 billion program to attempt to stabilize markets.

The pain in the equity markets was widespread and credit markets had issues of
their own, but there was some good news. Central Banks around the world added
significant liquidity to markets throughout the year, the U.S. Federal Reserve
cut rates on a number of occasions, and plans to stabilize markets were set in
motion.

The Index underperformed mid cap stocks by more than 4 percentage points during
the year, as the S&P MidCap 400 fell 16.68%. This relative under performance was
even more pronounced when compared to the Russell 2000 Index, which posted a
decline of 14.48%. In terms of style, the Index's performance was mixed; it
outperformed the S&P/Citigroup Value Index which declined by 24.50% while the
Index modestly underperformed relative to the S&P 500/Citigroup Growth which
fell by 19.44%. By comparison, International stocks posted even worse results as
evidenced by the MSCI EAFE Index which returned -30.50% and the MSCI ACWI ex US
Index which fell 30%.

(1) Net of expenses reimbursed by the Trustee.

(2) Portfolio turnover ratio excludes securities received or delivered from
    processing creations or redemptions of SPDRs.

(3) Net investment income per unit reflects receipt of a special one time
    dividend from a portfolio holding. The effect of this dividend amounted to
    $0.40 per share.

(4) Per share numbers have been calculated using the average shares method.

(5) Total return is calculated assuming a purchase of shares at net asset value
    per share on the first day and a sale at net asset value per share on the
    last day of each period reported. Distributions are assumed, for the
    purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at the net asset value per
    share on the respective payment dates of each Fund. Total return for a
    period of less than one year is not annualized. Broker commission charges
    are not included in the calculation.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2008

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided
interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the
common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard
& Poor's 500 Composite Price Index (the "S&P Index"). Each unit of fractional
undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's Depositary
Receipt ("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the
initial issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units" -- see
Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the
intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

Under the Trust Agreement, the Sponsor and Trustee (each as defined below) are
indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the performance of their
duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Trust
enters into contracts with service providers that contain general
indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these arrangements
is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made against the
Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the Trust expects
the risk of material loss to be remote.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires the Trustee to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
The value of the Trust's portfolio securities is based on the market price of
the securities, which generally means a valuation obtained from an exchange or
other market (or based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of
value supplied by an exchange or other market) or a valuation obtained from an
independent pricing service.

In September 2006, Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair
Value Measurements ("SFAS 157" or the "Statement"), was issued and is effective
for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS 157 defines fair value,
establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
fair value measurements. As a result, the Trust will adopt SFAS 157 for the
fiscal year beginning October 1, 2008. The Trustee is evaluating the application
of the Statement to the Trust, and believes the impact will be limited to
expanded disclosures resulting from the adoption of this Statement in the
Trust's financial statements.

INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

An investment in a Fund involves risks similar to those of investing in any fund
of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as
economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived
trends in stock prices. You should anticipate that the value of the Shares will
decline, more or less, in correlation with

any decline in value of the S&P Index. The values of equity securities could
decline generally or could underperform other investments. Further, a Fund would
not sell an equity security because the security's issuer was in financial
trouble unless that security is removed from the S&P Index.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to continue to qualify as a "regulated
investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. By so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal
income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per share calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

During 2008, the Trust reclassified $5,640,041,466 of non-taxable security
losses realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as a
decrease to paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At
September 30, 2008, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $403,831,303,
$472,492,447, $1,530,834,020, $445,024,832, $380,379,645, $1,174,140,896,
$1,056,971,322 and $916,001,003 which will expire on September 30, 2009,
September 30, 2010, September 30, 2011, September 30, 2012, September 30, 2013,
September 30, 2014, September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2016, respectively. The
Trust incurred losses of $2,417,956,389 during the period November 1, 2007
through September 30, 2008 that were deferred for tax purposes until fiscal
2009.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2008
was $1,782,447,532 of ordinary income. The tax character of distributions paid
during the year ended September 30, 2007 was $1,323,001,746 of ordinary income.
The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2006
was $1,059,134,562 of ordinary income.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)



As of September 30, 2008, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $0 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

On July 13, 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") released
FASB Interpretation No. 48 "Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes" ("FIN
48" or the "Interpretation"). FIN 48 provides guidance for how uncertain tax
positions should be recognized, measured, presented and disclosed in the
financial statements. FIN 48 requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or
expected to be taken in the course of preparing the Trust's tax return to
determine whether the tax positions are "more-likely-than-not" of being
sustained by the applicable tax authority. Tax positions not deemed to meet a
"more-likely-than-not" threshold would be recorded as a tax expense in the
current year. Adoption of FIN 48 is required for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2006 and is to be applied to all open tax years as of the effective
date.

The Trust adopted the provisions of FIN 48 on October 1, 2007. Management
evaluated the implications of FIN 48 and determined that the tax positions met
the "more-likely than not" threshold. There was no impact resulting from the
adoption of this Interpretation on the Trust's financial statements. The Trust's
federal tax returns for the prior three fiscal years remain subject to
examination by the Internal Revenue Service. It is the Trust's policy to record
interest and penalty charges on underpaid taxes associated with its tax
positions as interest expense and miscellaneous expense, respectively. No such
charges were recorded in the current financial statements.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides certain administrative services. The
Trustee is also responsible for determining the composition of the portfolio of
securities which must be delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance
and/or redemption of Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the
composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in
the composition and/or weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index. For these
services, the Trustee received a fee at the following annual rates for the year
ended September 30, 2008:

$2,500,000,000 - and above       Amount
</Table>


The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended September 30, 2008, the Adjustment Amount reduced the
Trustee's fee by $11,258,192. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $2,518,089 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $8,740,103. Prior to 2008, the Trustee earnings credits were presented
separately on the Statements of Operation.

Effective November 1, 2006, the Trustee changed the method of computing the
Adjustment Amount to the Trustee Fee such that all income earned with respect to
cash held for the benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee's

Fee. In addition, during the period from December 1, 2006 through December 31,
2006, the Trustee applied incremental cash balance credits of $5,918,238.

The Trustee voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fee, as needed, for one
year through February 1, 2009, so that the total operating expenses would not
exceed 9.45/100 of 1% (0.0945%) per annum of the daily net asset value. The
total amount of such reimbursement by the Trustee for the year ended September
30, 2008 was $6,923,474. The Trustee has not entered into an agreement with the
Trust to recapture waived fees in subsequent periods and the Trustee may
discontinue the voluntary waiver.

Standard and Poor's, a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P") and
State Street Global Markets, LLC ("SSGM") have entered into a License Agreement.
The License Agreement grants SSGM, an affiliate of the Trustee, a license to use
the S&P 500 Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Portfolio
and to use certain trade names and trademarks of S&P in connection with the
Portfolio. The Trustee on behalf of the Trust, NYSE Alternext US LLC, formerly
the American Stock Exchange LLC (the "NYSE Alternext"), and PDR Services LLC, a
wholly owned subsidiary of NYSE Alternext (the "Sponsor") have each received a
sublicense from SSGM and S&P for the use of the S&P 500 Index and such trade
names and trademarks in connection with their rights and duties with respect to
the Trust. Pursuant to such arrangements and in accordance with the Trust
Agreement, the Trust reimburses the Sponsor for payment of a sub-license fee to
the S&P equal to the greater of: (i) 0.03% of the daily average net assets of
the Trust plus a volume based fee ranging from $0.03 to $0.04 per round lot
trade of the average daily trading volume on NYSE Alternext or other exchange on
which the product may be listed, or (ii) $125,000, the minimum annual fee.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED ISSUERS
Certain investments made by the Trust represent securities affiliated with the
Trustee. Investments in State Street Corp., the holding company of State Street
Bank & Trust Company, were made according to its representative portion of the
S&P 500 Index. The market value of these investments at September 30, 2008 is
listed in the Schedule of Investments.

With the exception of the Trust's dividend reinvestment plan, SPDRs are issued
and redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000
SPDRs. Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate
cash payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per
SPDR (income equalization) and a balancing cash component to equate the
transaction to the net asset value per unit of the Trust on the transaction
date. A transaction fee of $3,000 is charged in connection with each creation or
redemption of Creation Units through the SPDR Clearing Process per participating
party per day, regardless of the number of Creation Units created or redeemed.
In the case of redemptions outside the SPDR Clearing Process, the Transaction
Fee plus an additional amount not to exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee
applicable for one Creation Unit per Creation Unit redeemed, and such amount is
deducted from the amount delivered to the redeemer. Transaction fees are
received by the Trustee and used to defray the expense of processing orders.

NOTE 5 -- INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
For the year ended September 30, 2008, the Trust had in-kind contributions, in-
kind redemptions, purchases and sales of investment securities of
$218,514,270,373, $183,079,120,310, $4,756,193,389, and $4,605,815,236,
respectively. At September 30, 2008, the cost of investments for federal income
tax purposes was $112,790,493,803, accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation
was $467,389,541 and gross unrealized depreciation was $20,321,900,446,
resulting in net unrealized depreciation of $19,854,510,905.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2008, the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trustee; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2008 by
correspondence with the custodian and brokers, and the application of
alternative auditing procedures where securities purchased had not been
received, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
