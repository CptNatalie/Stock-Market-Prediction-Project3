SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
The SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is an exchange traded fund designed to
generally correspond to the price and yield performance of the S&P 500(R) Index.

STRATEGY:
To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full replication approach. With this
strategy, all 500 securities of the S&P 500(R) Index are owned by the Trust in
their approximate market capitalization weight. A replication management
approach should result in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative to
its benchmark.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The Trust ended its fiscal year on September 30, 2009 with a 12-month total
return of -6.90% on net asset value as compared to the S&P 500(R) Index return
of -6.91%.

The Trust's performance reflects the operating expenses of the Trust, including
brokerage and Trustee fees. The S&P 500(R) Index returns do not reflect fees and
expenses of any kind, which would have a negative impact on returns.

(1) Per share numbers have been calculated using the average shares method.

(2) Net investment income per unit reflects receipt of a special one time
    dividend from a portfolio holding. The effect of this dividend amounted to
    $0.40 per share.

(3) Total return is calculated assuming a purchase of shares at net asset value
    per share on the first day and a sale at net asset value per share on the
    last day of each period reported. Distributions are assumed, for the
    purposes of this calculation, to be reinvested at the net asset value per
    share on the respective payment dates of each Fund. Total return for a
    period of less than one year is not annualized. Broker commission charges
    are not included in this calculation.

(4) Net of expenses reimbursed by the Trustee.

(5) Portfolio turnover ratio excludes securities received or delivered from
    processing creations or redemptions of SPDRs.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended. The Trust was created to provide investors with the
opportunity to purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided
interest in a portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the
component common stocks, in substantially the same weighting, which comprise the
Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Price Index (the "S&P 500 Index"). Each unit of
fractional undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's
Depositary Receipt ("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993
upon the initial issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation
Units" -- see Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to
reflect the intended portfolio composition of the Trust.

Under the Amended and Restated Standard Terms and Conditions of the Trust, as
amended ("Trust Agreement"), PDR Services, LLC, as Sponsor of the Trust
("Sponsor"), and State Street Bank and Trust Company, as Trustee of the Trust
("Trustee"), are indemnified against certain liabilities arising out of the
performance of their duties to the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of
business, the Trust enters into contracts with service providers that contain
general indemnification clauses. The Trust's maximum exposure under these
arrangements is unknown as this would involve future claims that may be made
against the Trust that have not yet occurred. However, based on experience the
Trust expects the risk of material loss to be remote.

The Sponsor and Trustee have approved an amendment, dated as of November 23,
2009, to the Trust Agreement to change the name of the Trust to "SPDR S&P 500
ETF Trust" and to make related conforming changes, effective on or around
January 26, 2010. The investment objective and policies of the Trust will remain
the same.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the
Trust in the preparation of its financial statements:

The preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

SECURITY VALUATION
The value of the Trust's portfolio securities is based on the market price of
the securities, which generally means a valuation obtained from an exchange or
other market (or based on a price quotation or other equivalent indication of
value supplied by an exchange or other market) or a valuation obtained from an
independent pricing service. If a security's market price is not readily
available or does not otherwise accurately reflect the fair value of the
security, the security will be valued by another method that State Street Bank
and Trust Company, in its capacity as Trustee, believes will better reflect fair
value in accordance with the Trust's valuation policies and procedures. The
Trustee has delegated the process of valuing securities for which market
quotations are not readily available or do not otherwise accurately reflect the
fair value of the security to the Pricing and Investment Committee (the
"Committee"). The Committee, subject to oversight by the Trustee, may use fair
value pricing in a variety of circumstances, including but not limited to,
situations when trading in a security has been suspended or halted. Accordingly,
the Trust's net asset value may reflect certain portfolio securities' fair
values rather than their market prices. Fair value pricing involves subjective
judgments and it is possible that the fair value determination for a security is
materially different than the value that could be received on the sale of the
security.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)



Effective October 1, 2008, the first day of the Trust's fiscal year 2009, the
Trust adopted the authoritative guidance for fair value measurements and the
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities. The guidance
for the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities
provides the Trust the irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and
liabilities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The
guidance also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value
that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of
unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when
available. The guidance establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to
measure fair value:

- - Level 1-- quoted prices in active markets for identical investments

- - Level 2-- other significant observable inputs (including, but not limited to,
  quoted prices for similar investments, interest rates, prepayment speeds,
  credit risk, etc.)

- - Level 3-- significant unobservable inputs (including the Trust's own
  assumptions in determining the fair value of investments)

Investments that use Level 2 or Level 3 inputs may include, but are not limited
to: (i) an unlisted security related to corporate actions; (ii) a restricted
security (e.g., one that may not be publicly sold without registration under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended); (iii) a security whose trading has been
suspended or which has been de-listed from its primary trading exchange; (iv) a
security that is thinly traded; (v) a security in default or bankruptcy
proceedings for which there is no current market quotation; (vi) a security
affected by currency controls or restrictions; and (vii) a security affected by
a significant event (e.g., an event that occurs after the close of the markets
on which the security is traded but before the time as of which the Trust's net
assets are computed and that may materially affect the value of the Trust's
investments). Examples of events that may be "significant events" are government
actions, natural disasters, armed conflicts, acts of terrorism, and significant
market fluctuations.

Fair value pricing could result in a difference between the prices used to
calculate the Trust's net asset value and the prices used by the S&P 500 Index,
which, in turn, could result in a difference between the Trust's performance and
the performance of the S&P 500 Index. The inputs or methodology used for
valuation are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with
investing in those investments. The type of inputs used to value each security
is identified in the Schedule of Investments, which also includes a breakdown of
the Trust's investments by industry.

The following table summarizes the inputs used in valuing the Trust's
investments, as of September 30, 2009:

<Table>

</Table>


SUBSEQUENT EVENTS
Management has evaluated the possibility of subsequent events existing in the
Trust's financial statements through November 24, 2009. Management has
determined that there are no material events that would require disclosure in
the Trust's financial statements through this date.

SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 2009

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)



INVESTMENT RISK
The Trust invests in various investments which are exposed to risks, such as
market risk. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investments it is
at least reasonably possible that changes in the values of investment securities
will occur in the near term and that such changes could materially affect the
amounts reported in the financial statements.

An investment in the Trust involves risks similar to those of investing in any
fund of equity securities, such as market fluctuations caused by such factors as
economic and political developments, changes in interest rates and perceived
trends in stock prices. The value of a SPDR will decline, more or less, in
correlation with any decline in value of the S&P 500 Index. The values of equity
securities could decline generally or could underperform other investments.
Further, the Trust would not sell an equity security because the security's
issuer was in financial trouble unless that security is removed from the S&P 500
Index.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust declares and distributes net realized capital
gains, if any, at least annually.

Effective October 30, 2009, the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Service is no
longer available. Broker-dealers, at their own discretion, may offer a dividend
reinvestment service under which additional SPDRs are purchased in the secondary
market at current market prices. Investors should consult their broker-dealer
for further information regarding any dividend reinvestment service offered by
such broker-dealer.

EQUALIZATION
The Trust follows the accounting practice known as "Equalization" by which a
portion of the proceeds from sales and costs of reacquiring the Trust's units,
equivalent on a per unit basis to the amount of distributable net investment
income on the date of the transaction, is credited or charged to undistributed
net investment income. As a result, undistributed net investment income per unit
is unaffected by sales or reacquisitions of the Trust's units.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to continue to qualify as a "regulated
investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended. By so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal
income taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from those determined in accordance with U.S.
generally accepted accounting principles. These differences are primarily due to
differing treatments for income equalization, in-kind transactions and losses
deferred due to wash sales. Net investment income per unit calculations in the
financial highlights for all years presented exclude these differences.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)



The Trust has reviewed the tax positions for the open tax years as of September
30, 2009 and has determined that no provision for income tax is required in the
Trust's Financial Statements. The Trust's federal tax returns for the prior
three fiscal years remain subject to examination by the Internal Revenue
Service.

During 2009, the Trust reclassified $43,549,328,499 of non-taxable security
losses realized from the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as a
decrease to paid in capital in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At
September 30, 2009, the cost of investments for federal tax purposes was
$61,972,554,261, accordingly, gross unrealized appreciation was $9,770,786,639
and gross unrealized depreciation was $121,828,186, resulting in net unrealized
appreciation of $9,648,958,453.

At September 30, 2009, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $472,492,447,
$1,530,834,020, $445,024,832, $380,379,645, $1,174,140,896, $1,056,971,322,
$917,820,735, and $2,555,216,739 which will expire on September 30, 2010,
September 30, 2011, September 30, 2012, September 30, 2013, September 30, 2014,
September 30, 2015, September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2017, respectively.
During the tax year ended September 30, 2009, the Trust had $403,831,303 of
capital loss carryforwards expire. The Trust incurred losses of $596,067,584
during the period November 1, 2008 through September 30, 2009 that were deferred
for tax purposes until fiscal 2010.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2009
was $1,938,730,332 of ordinary income. The tax character of distributions paid
during the year ended September 30, 2008 was $1,782,447,532 of ordinary income.
The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2007
was $1,323,001,746 of ordinary income.

As of September 30, 2009, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation/(depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $0 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trustee maintains the Trust's
accounting records, acts as custodian and transfer agent to the Trust, and
provides administrative services, including filing of certain regulatory
reports. The Trustee is also responsible for determining the composition of the
portfolio of securities which must be delivered and/or received in exchange for
the issuance and/or redemption of Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting
the composition of the Trust's portfolio from time to time to conform to changes
in the composition and/or weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index. For these
services, the Trustee received a fee at the following annual rates for the year
ended September 30, 2009:

<Table>
<Caption>
NET ASSET VALUE OF THE TRUST     FEE AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET ASSET VALUE OF THE TRUST
- ----------------------------     ---------------------------------------------------

                                 10/100 of 1% per annum plus or minus the Adjustment
$0 - $499,999,999                Amount

$2,500,000,000 - and above       Amount
</Table>


The Adjustment Amount is the sum of (a) the excess or deficiency of transaction
fees received by the Trustee, less the expenses incurred in processing orders
for creation and redemption of SPDRs and (b) the amounts earned by the Trustee
with respect to the cash held by the Trustee for the benefit of the Trust.
During the year ended September 30, 2009, the Adjustment Amount reduced the
Trustee's fee by $5,999,639. The Adjustment Amount included an excess of net
transaction fees from processing orders of $5,124,034 and a Trustee earnings
credit of $875,605. Prior to 2008, the Trustee earnings credits were presented
separately on the Statement of Operations.

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR - (CONTINUED)



Effective November 1, 2006, the Trustee changed the method of computing the
Adjustment Amount to the Trustee Fee such that all income earned with respect to
cash held for the benefit of the Trust is credited against the Trustee's Fee. In
addition, during the period from December 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006, the
Trustee applied incremental cash balance credits of $5,918,238.

The Trustee voluntarily agreed to waive a portion of its fee, as needed, for one
year through February 1, 2010, so that the total operating expenses would not
exceed 9.45/100 of 1% (0.0945%) per annum of the daily net asset value. The
total amount of such reimbursement by the Trustee for the year ended September
30, 2007, September 30, 2008 and September 30, 2009 was $4,970,832, $6,923,474
and $7,102,147 respectively. The Trustee has not entered into an agreement with
the Trust to recapture waived fees in subsequent periods and the trustee may
discontinue the voluntary waiver.

Standard and Poor's ("S&P"), a division of The McGraw Hill Companies, Inc. and
State Street Global Markets, LLC ("SSGM") have entered into a License Agreement.
The License Agreement grants SSGM, an affiliate of the Trustee, a license to use
the S&P 500 Index as a basis for determining the composition of the Portfolio
and to use certain trade names and trademarks of S&P in connection with the
Portfolio. The Trustee on behalf of the Trust, NYSE Arca, Inc. ("NYSE Arca") and
PDR Services LLC (the "Sponsor") have each received a sublicense from SSGM and
S&P for the use of the S&P 500 Index and such trade names and trademarks in
connection with their rights and duties with respect to the Trust. The License
Agreement may be amended without the consent of any of the owners of beneficial
interests of SPDRs. Currently, the License Agreement is scheduled to terminate
on December 31, 2017, but its term may be extended without the consent of any of
the owners of beneficial interests of SPDRs. Pursuant to such arrangements and
in accordance with the Trust Agreement, the Trust reimburses the Sponsor for
payment of fees under the License Agreement to S&P equal to 0.03% of the daily
size of the Trust (based on SPDR closing price and outstanding shares) plus an
annual fee of $600,000.

TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATED ISSUERS
The Trust has invested in securities issued by an affiliate of the Trustee.
Investments in State Street Corp., the holding company of State Street Bank &
Trust Company, as Trustee, were made according to its representative portion of
the S&P 500 Index. The market value of these investments at September 30, 2009
is listed in the Schedule of Investments.

NOTE 4 -- SHAREHOLDER TRANSACTIONS
With the exception of the Trust's Dividend Reinvestment Service in effect during
this fiscal year (see Note 2), SPDRs are issued and redeemed by the Trust only
in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 SPDRs. Such transactions are only
permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash payment which is equivalent
to the undistributed net investment income per SPDR (income equalization) and a
balancing cash component to equate the transaction to the net asset value per
unit of the Trust on the transaction date. A Transaction Fee of $3,000 is
charged in connection with each creation or redemption of Creation Units through
the SPDR Clearing Process per participating party per day, regardless of the
number of Creation Units created or redeemed. In the case of redemptions outside
the SPDR Clearing Process, the Transaction Fee plus an additional amount not to
exceed three (3) times the Transaction Fee applicable for one Creation Unit per
Creation Unit redeemed, and such amount is deducted from the amount delivered to
the redeemer. Transaction Fees are received by the Trustee and used to defray
the expense of processing orders.

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST, SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2009, the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trustee; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting
the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our
audits, which included confirmation of securities at September 30, 2009 by
correspondence with the custodian, and the application of alternative auditing
procedures where confirmations of securities purchased had not been received,
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
