SPDR TRUST SERIES 1
TRUST OVERVIEW
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OBJECTIVE:
To replicate the total return of the S&P 500 Index.

STRATEGY:
The Trust's holdings are comprised of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 Index, which
is designed to capture the price performance of a large cross-section of the
U.S. publicly traded stock market.

PERFORMANCE OVERVIEW:
The SPDR Trust, Series 1 (the "Trust") seeks to match the total return of the
S&P 500 Index. To accomplish this, the Trust utilizes a full replication
approach. With this strategy, all 500 securities of the S&P 500 Index are owned
by the Trust in their approximate market capitalization weight. A replication
management approach results in low expected tracking error of the Trust relative
to its benchmark.

The Trust ended its fiscal year on September 30, 2002 with a 12-month total
return of -20.46% on net asset value as compared to the S&P 500 Index return of
- -20.49%.

During this past year, the US markets continued to show weakness as a
culmination of factors put pressure on the US economy. Declining corporate
earnings continued to plague investors as corporations trimmed workforces in
search of higher earnings through lower labor costs. Large organizational
announcements regarding massive layoffs permeated the economy with unemployment
at 5.6% as of September 2002. The scandals that rocked Enron, WorldCom and other
companies have investors calling for more transparency in financial reporting
processes. Many companies have complied with these requests by expensing stock
options and disclosing more information in their financial reports than ever
before. More recently, the uncertainty regarding the war with Iraq has lead to
higher levels of volatility in the markets. The bastion of support for the
economy has been the housing sector, which continues to see strong growth and
consumer spending which has exceeded most economist estimates. Without this area
of support, the probability of a double dip recession would have increased.

All Standard & Poor's S&P 500 sectors posted negative returns for the 12-month
period ending September 30, 2002. Some sectors exhibited less volatility and
were more price inelastic than others. Consumer Staples showed the strongest
return for the period with a return of -3.09%, which is consistent with the
current economic cycle as consumers continue to purchase every day goods and
forgo non-essential items. Some notable names for the period include Coca-Cola
Enterprises (+41.3%) and Procter & Gamble (+23.6%). The Materials sector return
was -8.5% for the period making it the second strongest sector. The best
performing names in the Materials sector were Ball Corp. (+92.7%) and
Worthington Industries (+39.3%). The weaker performing names included Georgia
Pacific (-62.8%) and Allegheney Technologies (-58.3%). The weakest sectors
during the period were Telecommunication Services (-56.70%), Utilities (-32.31%)
and Information Technology (-31.2%). Some of the notable names in the Technology
sector include Intuit (+20.5%) and Electronic Arts (+14.3%). The weakest returns
in the Technology sector include Avaya (-87.4%), PMC Sierra (-87.4%) and Corning
(-86.7%).

SPDR TRUST SERIES 1
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
SEPTEMBER 30, 2002
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE 1 -- ORGANIZATION
SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust") is a unit investment trust created under the
laws of the State of New York and registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The Trust was created to provide investors with the opportunity to
purchase a security representing a proportionate undivided interest in a
portfolio of securities consisting of substantially all of the common stocks, in
substantially the same weighting, which comprise the Standard & Poor's 500
Composite Stock Price Index (the "S&P 500 Index"). Each unit of fractional
undivided interest in the Trust is referred to as a Standard & Poor's Depositary
Receipt ("SPDR"). The Trust commenced operations on January 22, 1993 upon the
initial issuance of 150,000 SPDRs (equivalent to three "Creation Units" -- see
Note 4) in exchange for a portfolio of securities assembled to reflect the
intended portfolio composition of the Trust. Effective September 30, 1997, the
fiscal year end of the Trust changed from December 31 to September 30.

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates. The
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed by the Trust.

SECURITY VALUATION
Portfolio securities are valued based on the closing sale price on the exchange
which is deemed to be the principal market for the security. If no closing sale
price is available, then the security is valued at the previous closing sale
price on the exchange which is deemed to be the principal market for the
security. If there is no closing sale price available, valuation will be
determined by the Trustee in good faith based on available information.

INVESTMENT TRANSACTIONS
Investment transactions are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and
losses from the sale or disposition of securities are recorded on the identified
cost basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.

DISTRIBUTIONS TO UNITHOLDERS
The Trust declares and distributes dividends from net investment income to its
unitholders quarterly. The Trust will distribute net realized capital gains, if
any, at least annually.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX
The Trust has qualified and intends to qualify as a "regulated investment
company" under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By
so qualifying and electing, the Trust will not be subject to federal income
taxes to the extent it distributes its taxable income, including any net
realized capital gains, for each fiscal year. In addition, by distributing
during each calendar year substantially all of its net investment income and
capital gains, if any, the Trust will not be subject to federal excise tax.
Income and capital gain distributions are determined in accordance with income
tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles.
These differences are primarily due to differing treatments for income
equalization, in-kind transactions and losses deferred due to wash sales. Net
investment income per share calculations in the financial highlights for all
years presented exclude these differences.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)
SEPTEMBER 30, 2002
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE 2 -- SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES - (CONTINUED)
During 2002, the Trust reclassified $598,865,807 of non-taxable security gains
realized in the in-kind redemption of Creation Units (Note 4) as an increase to
paid in surplus in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. At September 30,
2002, the Trust had capital loss carryforwards of $33,523, $27,700,040,
$56,816,996, $403,831,303 and $472,492,447 which will expire on September 30,
2005, September 30, 2007, September 30, 2008, September 30, 2009 and September
30, 2010 respectively. The Trust incurred losses of $1,517,821,607 during the
period November 1, 2001 through September 30, 2002 that were deferred for tax
purposes until fiscal 2003.

The tax character of distributions paid during the year ended September 30, 2002
was $425,983,780 of ordinary income.

As of September 30, 2002, the components of distributable earnings (excluding
unrealized appreciation (depreciation)) on the tax basis were undistributed
ordinary income of $102,454,018 and undistributed long term capital gain of $0.

NOTE 3 -- TRANSACTIONS WITH THE TRUSTEE AND SPONSOR
In accordance with the Trust Agreement, State Street Bank and Trust Company (the
"Trustee") maintains the Trust's accounting records, acts as custodian and
transfer agent to the Trust, and provides administrative services, including
filing of all required regulatory reports. The Trustee is also responsible for
determining the composition of the portfolio of securities which must be
delivered and/or received in exchange for the issuance and/or redemption of
Creation Units of the Trust, and for adjusting the composition of the Trust's
portfolio from time to time to conform to changes in the composition and/or
weighting structure of the S&P 500 Index. For these services, the Trustee
received a fee at the following annual rates for the year ended September 30,
2002:

redeemed by the Trust only in Creation Unit size aggregations of 50,000 SPDRs.
Such transactions are only permitted on an in-kind basis, with a separate cash
payment which is equivalent to the undistributed net investment income per SPDR

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS

TO THE TRUSTEE AND UNITHOLDERS OF
SPDR TRUST SERIES 1

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities, including
the schedule of investments, and the related statements of operations and of
changes in net assets and the financial highlights present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of SPDR Trust Series 1 (the "Trust")
at September 30, 2002, and the results of its operations, the changes in its net
assets and the financial highlights for the periods indicated, in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.
These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter referred to as
"financial statements") are the responsibility of the Trust's management; our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on
our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial statements in accordance
with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America,
which require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance
about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits, which included
confirmation of securities at September 30, 2002 by correspondence with the
custodian, provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
